#SystemDesignAndAnalysis
#This is a repository for the analysis, and design of a system for the customer, DriverPass.

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was the CEO, and Security officer of "DriverPass," a company looking to streamline driving study material for students looking to aquire their licences. The Client wanted me to design a system that can be accessed from anywhere, via web browser. To avoid creating duel data within the database I opted to create a system that can only be updated when the user has an internet connection, but allowed the CEO to download records from the system to perform their own data analysis using an external program --such as excel.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I captured, and interpretted, all of DriverPass's system requirements along side general IT system requirements with platform restrictions in mind. This ensured that the system can be used as intended but also securely.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One of the main things I would revise in the documents are some of the UML diagrams. I feel like some of the requirements were implied in the context of the rest of the document, but the diagrams themselves didn't explicitly express that portion of the requirements as effectively as they could be. I also believe adding additional sub-process models could allow documentation to explain the deeper logic of the system.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpretted the users needs by collecting use-cases for the system. Once I understood how the system would be used I could apply technical understanding and restrictions to determine the best way provide a design for the client. This is important because the user has requirements for the system to be able to be used as intended while providing a realistic perspect on the design the client envisioned. If the system did not meet the needs of the client than it would almost render the system useless.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by creating, and gathering user stories and converting them into use-cases. Once I have use cases I can create documentation on different aspects of the system or application I am designing. This will include various UML diagrams --actvity, sequence, and process models-- as well as object/class models and flow charts. Keeping these different angles of the system program in line could further the ability to design and program appropriate objects for the intended use-cases, and the use of objects will ease the burden on the developers. I believe I will continue to use this strategy because it made it ease to modularize the design, and could make it extremely easy to program the correct classes and how they will behave with one another in the main program loop.
